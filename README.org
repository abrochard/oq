#+TITLE: oq

Org query tool to manipulate emacs lisp expression of org documents, inspired by jq

* Usage

Inside an org document
#+begin_src text
  M-x oq
#+end_src

You will see two buffers: "*oq - query*" and "*oq - output*".

Write an expression in the query buffer and press =C-c C-c= to see the result in the output buffer

* Syntax

  - =N= to grab the Nth child of the current element (starting from 0)
  - =:prop= to print the property prop the element
  - ='name= to iterate over all elements matching that name

** Example
   See the [[sample.org]] document, a simple query can be

   #+begin_src text
     1 'headline :raw-value
   #+end_src

   1. grab the second element from root ("Another Section")
   2. iterate over every =headline= child element
   3. print the =:raw-value= of every item
